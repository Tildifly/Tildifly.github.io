                    Regulus Black has realistic expectations for his life.
                    He doesn't expect privacy, he's a celebrity after all. He doesn't expect his estranged brother to
                    ever talk to him again, it's been over ten years. He certainly doesn't expect to fall in love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then somehow James Potter comes along and flips every single one of those expectations on their
                    head.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James Potter has a plan.
                    He's going to focus his career until the day he meets someone he can spend the rest of his life with
                    and settle down. This plan does not include falling in love with his best friend's long-hated
                    brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James doesn't account for Regulus Black.

                    Regulus Black, presumed dead for over 2 years, shows up at an Order of the Phoenix meeting with 6
                    mangled horcruxes and Voldemort's corpse.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How does the wizarding world move on following the abrupt end of the war, and how does Regulus come
                    to terms with the last four years of his life?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not on his own evidently, as his brother makes an effort to return to his life, James Potter tries
                    to weasel his way into his heart and the friends he left behind in the name of the war aren't
                    willing to leave him alone any longer.

                    Regulus closes his eyes and shakes his head again, looking pained, then he opens them and sighs.
                    "And your solution to this is me? Pretending to be my boyfriend?"
                    <br> <br>
                    "Yeah. It's actually bloody brilliant, if you think about it. Everyone will leave happy. I'm going
                    to fake date my way into falling in love," James announces grandly, sticking his hand out and waving
                    it through the air like he's presenting a banner.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    Or, the one in which James Potter wants to prove he'd be a good boyfriend to Lily Evans and comes up
                    with the brilliant plan to fake date Regulus Black his way into falling in love. It doesn't quite go
                    as anyone expects.

                    “First of all, I would like to say that every single bit of work you’ve done in this case is greatly
                    appreciated, and you have saved so many lives,” she says. Barty’s heart drops for a moment.
                    <br><br>
                    “You’re not taking me off it?” He says.
                    <br><br>
                    “No,” she shakes her head quickly. “Of course not. I’d like you to be the agent who stays with Evan
                    Rosier in the safe house.”
                    <br><br>
                    “You what?” Barty stares at her. No way. “Absolutely not. No way in hell. I respect you, Andromeda,
                    but there is no way I’m staying in a house with that man for however long we have to.”
