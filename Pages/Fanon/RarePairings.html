                    "Huh." Theo stares at Harry with those grey eyes that look silver in the cauldron smoke between
                    them. "But you're the heir to this ... House of Prince, so he's probably -"

                    Something loosens inside Harry's chest. Something that has been tightening ever since Cedric died.
                    He may not have his friends, or Sirius, or even know who he fucking is anymore, but he has this. At
                    least he has Theo.

                    Summer of 4th year and Harry's all alone, dealing with his grief and the sudden revelation that
                    James Potter is not his father. Support comes in a strange form. The form of Theo Nott, son of a
                    death Eater. A strange friend who says he'll help him find his true father, whoever this Lord Prince
                    might be.

                <p class="description">Vivian Blair is the summation of everything Sirius hates: a prefect, a pureblood,
                    and a Slytherin. It doesn't matter that she makes a half decent Seeker, has an unnatural obsession
                    for reading muggle books, or even that Lily thinks she's a reasonable human being. Vivian is just a
                    bitchy Slytherin who likes to call him a blood traitor and give him detentions. Fortunately, he has
                    an idea to get back at her for everything she's ever done to him. He should know better than to toy
                    with fate, for the more love poems he writes to Vivian Blair, the less of a prank they become, and
                    the more fate seems intent on getting some revenge of its own.</p>

                    Regulus thought after what happened when Sirius came out, his mother would have reacted differently
                    when it was his turn to make the confession. That she wouldn’t lose both sons. But he was wrong.
                    <br> <br>
                    That’s how he finds himself waiting to be picked-up by the brother he hasn’t seen in 3 years. Ready
                    to crash on his couch in the small city of Berkeley, California.
                    <br><br>
                    Sirius’ flatmates are a far cry from his London friends. There’s his boyfriend, Remus. A graduate
                    student who plays albums that sound more like noise than melody. Peter, who’s quiet and kind and
                    brings everyone coffee and bagels from his job. And James, who seems intent on ignoring Regulus’
                    presence completely, even when Regulus gets a job beside him at their local record shop.
                    <br><br>
                    Or, James Potter was doing his best not to defile his roommate's younger brother because Sirius told

                    Six weeks is a long time, but also no time at all. As the Black brothers unexpectedly reunite after

                    maybe rules are meant to be broken.<br>
                    Getting involved with Regulus is going to hurt, but James believes it'll be worth it. Either way,

                    James and Regulus have a summer fling that they promised their friends they wouldn’t have. Remus and
                    Sirius discover their mutual hatred is just pent-up sexual tension. Dorcas and Marlene are always
                    winning, even when they’re not.
                    It’s a cruel summer for all.
                    I love you (ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?)

                <p class="description">“The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my
                    position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop;
                    but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at
                    him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don’t realize is that we’re not playing chess anymore.”

                    Harry Evans was almost like any other boy growing up in Cokeworth. He lived alone in a house nobody
                    else could see, he stole food from the supermarket and never got caught, and he had a little brother
                    who had been hidden after the night their mother was killed. Harry was a secret, and he promised not
                    to tell.

                    A letter in an empty vault, a small boy with broken glasses, a portrait of a scowling girl. As Harry
                    begins unraveling his own past, the threat against his brother grows.
                    <br><br>
                    How long will his secrets keep when Harry is the only one standing between his brother and the
                    world?

                <p class="description">‘“You can’t go alone Harry,” Hermione said, trying to lift herself to her feet
                    but giving up with a squeak, “You need help!”<br>
                    “No,” Harry said firmly, “This is my decision to run off to try and save Sirius, no one else’s - and
                    you need help Hermione! Look at your ankle!”<br>
                    “How are you even getting there?” Ron demanded, “Cause’ if you want to floo, it looks like we both
                    need to go back up to the castle,” he cried triumphantly.<br>
                    The answer to his question came in the form of a sudden insistent tugging at the sleeve of Harry’s
                    robe. He flinched back, and looked down to find the skeletal head of doe-eyed Thestral following the
                    path of his hand in an attempt to lick off the blood that coated his arm. Harry froze for a minute,
                    then grinned. He knew exactly how he was getting to London.’

                    When Harry made the choice to leave his friends behind, and rescue Sirius from the Department of
                    Mysteries on his own, he had never imagined what the consequences might be.
