                    Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice
                    graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble
                    thrown into the water causes ripples.

                    "So you're adopted?

                    "Seems like it."
                    "Huh." Theo stares at Harry with those grey eyes that look silver in the cauldron smoke between
                    them. "But you're the heir to this ... House of Prince, so he's probably -"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Yes. Probably." Harry looks at Theo sharply. "You don't know who he is, do you?"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "No." Theo looks back just as sharply. "If I did, I would tell you. You know I would."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "I do."

                    <br>
                    Something loosens inside Harry's chest. Something that has been tightening ever since Cedric died.
                    He may not have his friends, or Sirius, or even know who he fucking is anymore, but he has this. At
                    least he has Theo.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Summer of 4th year and Harry's all alone, dealing with his grief and the sudden revelation that
                    James Potter is not his father. Support comes in a strange form. The form of Theo Nott, son of a
                    death Eater. A strange friend who says he'll help him find his true father, whoever this Lord Prince
                    might be.

                    appreciated, and you have saved so many lives,” she says. Barty’s heart drops for a moment.

                <p class="description">Vivian Blair is the summation of everything Sirius hates: a prefect, a pureblood,
                    and a Slytherin. It doesn't matter that she makes a half decent Seeker, has an unnatural obsession
                    for reading muggle books, or even that Lily thinks she's a reasonable human being. Vivian is just a
                    bitchy Slytherin who likes to call him a blood traitor and give him detentions. Fortunately, he has
                    an idea to get back at her for everything she's ever done to him. He should know better than to toy
                    with fate, for the more love poems he writes to Vivian Blair, the less of a prank they become, and
                    the more fate seems intent on getting some revenge of its own.</p>
