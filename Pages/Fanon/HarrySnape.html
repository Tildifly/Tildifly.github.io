                <p class="description">Severus Snape wakes up after the war to find that over twenty years have passed
                    and Nagini's venom has wreaked havoc on his body. While he searches for a way to heal the damage,
                    Severus has to find a way to come to terms with the new world into which he's awoken as well as the
                    ancient magic that helped to bring him back.</p>
