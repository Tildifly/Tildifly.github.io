                <p class="description">Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the
                    might of the
                    magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order
                    secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve
                    until her mind can be cracked.</p>

                    <em>As she looked around her living room - at the green velvet ottoman she didn't remember
                        purchasing, the 14th century Wizarding texts on her bookshelf, the hideous and obnoxiously
                        ostentatious grandfather clock that could only belong to a Malfoy - she pictured the toothbrush
                        next to hers on her bathroom counter, the old Slytherin quidditch jersey she regularly tripped
                        over in her bedroom, and the mint chocolate chip ice cream in her freezer - a flavour she
                        abhorred, but that a particular, pale, pointy faced aristocrat sat across from her had a tragic
                        fondness for.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Her chest burning, as if she drank a barrel of bubotuber pus, Hermione turned to him with
                        narrowed, accusing eyes. "Malfoy...are we dating?"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </em>If there's one thing Hermione Granger knows, it's that she simply doesn't have time to date.
                    Draco decides to date her, anyway.
