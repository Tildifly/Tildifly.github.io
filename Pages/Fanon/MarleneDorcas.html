                    Regulus Black has realistic expectations for his life.
                    He doesn't expect privacy, he's a celebrity after all. He doesn't expect his estranged brother to
                    ever talk to him again, it's been over ten years. He certainly doesn't expect to fall in love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then somehow James Potter comes along and flips every single one of those expectations on their
                    head.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James Potter has a plan.
                    He's going to focus his career until the day he meets someone he can spend the rest of his life with
                    and settle down. This plan does not include falling in love with his best friend's long-hated
                    brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James doesn't account for Regulus Black.

                    Regulus closes his eyes and shakes his head again, looking pained, then he opens them and sighs.
                    "And your solution to this is me? Pretending to be my boyfriend?"
                    <br> <br>
                    "Yeah. It's actually bloody brilliant, if you think about it. Everyone will leave happy. I'm going
                    to fake date my way into falling in love," James announces grandly, sticking his hand out and waving
                    it through the air like he's presenting a banner.

                    with the brilliant plan to fake date Regulus Black his way into falling in love. It doesn't quite go
                    as anyone expects.

                <p class="description">When James Potter answers a mysterious ad in his local coffee shop, the last
                    thing he expects is to be thrown into a world of white collar crime, but how can he resist when the
                    mastermind behind the operation has dark hair and brooding eyes and promises wealth beyond James'
                    wildest imagination? He would do anything for that boy named after a star, including stealing
                    millions of dollars of fine art.</p>

                    “Remus Lupin, frontman for The Six.” Sirius took a long drag off his cigarette, looking up at the
                    dense evening sky. “You know, I asked around about you. You’re quite the mystery.”
                    <br><br>
                    Remus shrugged. “Not much for the spotlight.”
                    <br><br>
                    “Right,” Sirius drawled. “I bet you’re also not much for the rock ‘n roll perks.”
                    <br><br>
                    Remus tensed, sparing Sirius a scathing glance. “I’m sober now.”
                    <br><br>
                    Sirius quirked a brow in disbelief. Remus scowled at his nonchalance, unwilling to explain himself
                    and scared that maybe, just maybe, the disbelief was warranted.

                <p class="description">

                    Regulus’ best friend Dorcas convinces him to go on a summer trip with her. She dubs it ‘operation
                    make Reg smile again'. It's his chance to break from the cycle of toxic mistakes he keeps repeating
                    in London.<br>
                    James wouldn’t know casual if she walked up to him and introduced herself. That’s why he’s got a
                    rule to protect himself from heartbreak: only hook up with tourists on their last night in town.<br>
                    When James learns the gorgeous tourist he’s just met is around for six weeks, he gets spooked.<br>
                    Six weeks is a long time, but also no time at all. As the Black brothers unexpectedly reunite after
                    ten years apart, James and Regulus are forced to spend time together and James starts to think that
                    maybe rules are meant to be broken.<br>
                    Getting involved with Regulus is going to hurt, but James believes it'll be worth it. Either way,
                    James knows what he signed up for. Or does he?
                    <br><br>
                    OR
                    <br><br>
                    James and Regulus have a summer fling that they promised their friends they wouldn’t have. Remus and
                    Sirius discover their mutual hatred is just pent-up sexual tension. Dorcas and Marlene are always
                    winning, even when they’re not.
                    It’s a cruel summer for all.
                    I love you (ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?)

                <p class="description">Marlene McKinnon is a mess. She can’t sleep, she’s almost certainly going to fail
                    all her NEWTs, and she’s 99% sure that if they don’t win the Quidditch Cup this year James Potter
                    will throw himself headfirst off the Astronomy Tower. On top of all that, there’s a war on, yet
                    their professors seem determined to pretend that the biggest problem any of them are facing is
                    finding a Ministry internship. Marlene’s final year at Hogwarts has barely started, and she’s
                    already pretty sure it couldn’t get any worse—that is, until she shows up for her first Potions
                    class and hears the assignment.

                    Dorcas Meadowes is a stone-cold bitch. At least, that’s what everyone says. She doesn’t need
                    well-meaning professors or overeager classmates or teammates or boyfriends or friends. She doesn’t
                    need anything except to be left alone, the way she likes, until the day she finally leaves school.
                    And she certainly doesn’t need Marlene McKinnon, with her sharp tongue and her snorting laugh and
                    her stupid shiny hair, who seems intent on ruining everything that Dorcas has been working towards
                    for the past two years.
