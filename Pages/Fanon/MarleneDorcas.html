                    go around for everything to come crashing down around them.)

                    Regulus Black has realistic expectations for his life.
                    He doesn't expect privacy, he's a celebrity after all. He doesn't expect his estranged brother to
                    ever talk to him again, it's been over ten years. He certainly doesn't expect to fall in love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then somehow James Potter comes along and flips every single one of those expectations on their
                    head.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James Potter has a plan.
                    He's going to focus his career until the day he meets someone he can spend the rest of his life with
                    and settle down. This plan does not include falling in love with his best friend's long-hated
                    brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James doesn't account for Regulus Black.

                    Regulus closes his eyes and shakes his head again, looking pained, then he opens them and sighs.
                    "And your solution to this is me? Pretending to be my boyfriend?"
                    <br> <br>
                    "Yeah. It's actually bloody brilliant, if you think about it. Everyone will leave happy. I'm going
                    to fake date my way into falling in love," James announces grandly, sticking his hand out and waving
                    it through the air like he's presenting a banner.
                    <br><br>
                    ***
                    <br><br>
                    Or, the one in which James Potter wants to prove he'd be a good boyfriend to Lily Evans and comes up
                    with the brilliant plan to fake date Regulus Black his way into falling in love. It doesn't quite go
                    as anyone expects.

                <p class="description">When James Potter answers a mysterious ad in his local coffee shop, the last
                    thing he expects is to be thrown into a world of white collar crime, but how can he resist when the
                    mastermind behind the operation has dark hair and brooding eyes and promises wealth beyond James'
                    wildest imagination? He would do anything for that boy named after a star, including stealing
                    millions of dollars of fine art.</p>
