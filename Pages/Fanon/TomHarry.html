                <p class="description"><em>What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.”
                        He
                        marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do
                        you
                        know why?”

                        <br><br>“No. And I’ll be honest here, Riddle, I don’t particularly care.”
                        <br><br>
                        The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose
                        and
                        brushed some of Harry’s fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid
                        of
                        his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you…”
                        <br><br>
                        He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.”
                        <br><br></em>
                    After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a
                    tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. Seeking answers to his strange
                    predicament, Harry returns to Hogwarts, and causes quite the stir through staff and students -
                    especially when they come to realise he is not the same boy as before.
                    <br><br>
                    He tries to avoid suspicion, but as his quest for the truth draws more and more attention to him,
                    Harry begins to think that he might not like what he will discover.

                    Harry Potter disappears when he is four years old and the wizarding world believes him dead. But
                    when his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, Harry returns in a storm of lightning; a grown man
                    raised in a world of violence, more powerful than anyone could imagine, and the worst thing of all?
                    He doesn't care two knuts about the wizarding world.
                    <br><br>
                    Naturally, Voldemort is intrigued by this new and improved adversary.

                <p class="description">

                    Harry is removed from the Dursley family when he is eight years old, and enters the wizarding world
                    a few years younger and a lot wiser. He discovers a surprising dark heritage, and develops goals
                    that do not involve vanquishing a certain Dark Lord or becoming the Chosen One. Adopted into the
                    Black family, Harry will fight against the expectation that he is to defeat the Dark Lord and
                    instead dedicates himself to protecting the dark legacy that has been left to him.

                    <em>His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians’ pavilion. His gaze
                        locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.
                        <br><br>
                        It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure.
                        <br><br>
                        But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man’s lips. It was
                        almost pleased.
                        <br><br></em>
                    On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her
                    husband’s life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise
                    him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to
                    the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.
                    <br><br>
                    But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry, now known as Hadrian, is forced
                    to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark
                    Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows,
                    so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

                <p class="description">In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood
                    supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda
                    that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only
                    accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself
                    in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name
                    "Tom".</p>

                    A disastrous trip to a waterpark (thanks, Dudley!) unleashes almost 200 lifetimes worth of memories,
                    and now Harry is stuck as a ten-year-old while his soulmate is a wraith set on killing him.
                    <br><br>
                    A very old and cynical Harry sets about correcting Tom’s poor life-choices while avoiding Dumbledore
                    and his Order’s panicked searches for the Boy Who Disappeared.
                    <br><br>
                    As far as Harry is concerned, the whole world can fuck off. He couldn’t care less he’s finally Harry
                    Potter again, or that he can finally see his original loved ones again. The only thing that matters
                    is getting Tom back safe and sane and with his soul intact.

                    There was another student here.
                    <br><br>
                    Tom recognized him vaguely—while transfer students were not necessarily uncommon due to the war,
                    they were rare enough to at least make an impression. This particular transfer student was in his
                    year, sorted into Ravenclaw after an impressively long hat stall. He looked like he might be
                    descended from the Potter line, but he did not share the surname so his lineage was of no particular
                    interest to Tom. Nothing about him was of particular interest to Tom, in fact, and yet here he
                    stood, holding the book that Tom had come here to find.
                    <br><br>
                    It would be a good time to turn away. The Restricted Section was restricted for a reason—only books
                    documenting extremely dangerous or extremely advanced magic were stored here.
                    <br><br>
                    Tom’s feet, however, suddenly felt as if they were made of lead. It wasn’t magic keeping him tied
                    down, but something far more mysterious like curiosity or even fate. In any case, the delay was all
                    it took for the Ravenclaw to lift his chin and meet Tom’s eyes.
                    <br><br>
                    This Ravenclaw, Tom realized, had eyes as blindingly green as the Killing Curse.
