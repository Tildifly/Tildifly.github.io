                    In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like
                    the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised
                    to find that he’s eager to learn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then he gets the bad news: he’s been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted
                    again. Everyone is confident that he’ll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been
                    learning, Harry’s not so sure.

                <p class="description"> If there's one thing that Draco Malfoy yearns for, it's seeing Harry Potter in
                    pain. How that happens, he doesn't care. When Potter's name is pulled out of the Goblet of Fire,
                    Draco sees it as the perfect opportunity to fulfill his greatest desire. Except Saint Potter has
                    luck swimming in his veins. He needs to be distracted... And the best way to do that is to make him
                    fall in love.

                <p class="description">

                    All it takes is one look in a mirror and an ill-advised attempt to shatter it, before an embittered
                    Draco Malfoy fresh out of Azkaban is sent back into his body on the day he gets his Hogwarts letter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Suddenly, Draco has an unwanted second chance, with a Sorting Hat that doesn't know what to do with
                    him, a certain Muggleborn who won't leave his study table alone, and green eyes he just can't get
                    out of his head. And then there's his new wand, whose choice of him could just mark him as every bit
                    as dark a wizard as his name means he should be.
