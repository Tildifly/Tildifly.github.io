                    In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like
                    the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised
                    to find that he’s eager to learn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then he gets the bad news: he’s been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted
                    again. Everyone is confident that he’ll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been
                    learning, Harry’s not so sure.

                <p class="description"> If there's one thing that Draco Malfoy yearns for, it's seeing Harry Potter in
                    pain. How that happens, he doesn't care. When Potter's name is pulled out of the Goblet of Fire,
                    Draco sees it as the perfect opportunity to fulfill his greatest desire. Except Saint Potter has
                    luck swimming in his veins. He needs to be distracted... And the best way to do that is to make him
                    fall in love.

                    All it takes is one look in a mirror and an ill-advised attempt to shatter it, before an embittered
                    Draco Malfoy fresh out of Azkaban is sent back into his body on the day he gets his Hogwarts letter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Suddenly, Draco has an unwanted second chance, with a Sorting Hat that doesn't know what to do with
                    him, a certain Muggleborn who won't leave his study table alone, and green eyes he just can't get
                    out of his head. And then there's his new wand, whose choice of him could just mark him as every bit
                    as dark a wizard as his name means he should be.

                <p class="description">Several years after the war, an ostracized Draco Malfoy covers himself in
                    tattoos, becomes best friends with a muggle, and debates abandoning magical society entirely to work
                    in a tattoo shop. All in all, he's having a hell of a time trying to figure out who he is and what
                    he wants to do with his life. The last thing he needs is to run into Harry Potter, who seems intent
                    on becoming his friend, even if he has to get a lot of ink to do it.</p>

                <p class="description">When Draco’s cover is blown during a deep undercover operation and the Ministry
                    is compromised, Ron takes Draco to the only safe place he can think of—Potter. Hiding out with a
                    taciturn Harry Potter, who has been missing from the Wizarding World for almost two decades after a
                    shocking fall from grace, is nothing like Draco thought it would be. Draco has to navigate dealing
                    with this Potter while being hunted by Dark wizards and wanted by extremists in the Ministry. When
                    things take a turn for the worse, Draco has to decide whether he's going to keep running or find a
                    way to protect the world and the people he cares about most.</p>

                <p class="description">‘“You can’t go alone Harry,” Hermione said, trying to lift herself to her feet
                    but giving up with a squeak, “You need help!”<br>
                    “No,” Harry said firmly, “This is my decision to run off to try and save Sirius, no one else’s - and
                    you need help Hermione! Look at your ankle!”<br>
                    “How are you even getting there?” Ron demanded, “Cause’ if you want to floo, it looks like we both
                    need to go back up to the castle,” he cried triumphantly.<br>
                    The answer to his question came in the form of a sudden insistent tugging at the sleeve of Harry’s
                    robe. He flinched back, and looked down to find the skeletal head of doe-eyed Thestral following the
                    path of his hand in an attempt to lick off the blood that coated his arm. Harry froze for a minute,
                    then grinned. He knew exactly how he was getting to London.’
                    <br><br>
                    —
                    <br><br>
                    When Harry made the choice to leave his friends behind, and rescue Sirius from the Department of
                    Mysteries on his own, he had never imagined what the consequences might be.
