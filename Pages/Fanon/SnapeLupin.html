                <p class="description">

                    "So you're adopted?
                    "Supposedly."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "So your Dad ... he's not ...?"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Seems like it."
                    "Huh." Theo stares at Harry with those grey eyes that look silver in the cauldron smoke between
                    them. "But you're the heir to this ... House of Prince, so he's probably -"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Yes. Probably." Harry looks at Theo sharply. "You don't know who he is, do you?"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "No." Theo looks back just as sharply. "If I did, I would tell you. You know I would."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "I do."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Something loosens inside Harry's chest. Something that has been tightening ever since Cedric died.
                    He may not have his friends, or Sirius, or even know who he fucking is anymore, but he has this. At
                    least he has Theo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Summer of 4th year and Harry's all alone, dealing with his grief and the sudden revelation that
                    James Potter is not his father. Support comes in a strange form. The form of Theo Nott, son of a
                    death Eater. A strange friend who says he'll help him find his true father, whoever this Lord Prince
                    might be.
