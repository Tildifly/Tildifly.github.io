                    Regulus Black is angry. He wants revenge. He wants to watch the world burn for all it's done to him.
                    He also wants to make out with James Potter, but that's a secret he'll take to the grave. Vengeance
                    is more important than... whatever it is that chokes him when he lays eyes on Potter.
                    <br><br>
                    James Potter is confused, because Regulus Black is, all of a sudden, hot. And it's unfair because
                    Sirius is going to kill him if he doesn't get his impulse control in line.
                    <br><br>

                    A fic about two idiots falling in love (x2 because there's wolfstar, too) during a war, and the
                    sacrifices they'll have to make to survive it.

                    Regulus Black has realistic expectations for his life.
                    He doesn't expect privacy, he's a celebrity after all. He doesn't expect his estranged brother to
                    ever talk to him again, it's been over ten years. He certainly doesn't expect to fall in love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then somehow James Potter comes along and flips every single one of those expectations on their
                    head.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James Potter has a plan.
                    He's going to focus his career until the day he meets someone he can spend the rest of his life with
                    and settle down. This plan does not include falling in love with his best friend's long-hated
                    brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James doesn't account for Regulus Black.

                <h3 class="author">writingamarie</h3>
                <p class="description">"Baby Black, do you maybe not hate me?" James joked in a way that made Regulus
                    feel uncomfortable.<br>
                    "You are the most annoying person I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. And that says a lot
                    considering the absolute gems I've met in Slytherin."<br>
                    "A joke. Regulus Black made a joke. A mean one, at my expense, but a joke nonetheless... You know
                    baby Black, we could be friends."
                    "I would rather fling myself off the Astronomy Tower..."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ***
                    Or: Regulus is concerned about Sirius after their mother orchestrates a horrible attack. And with
                    Sirius out of reach he relies on James Potter to know his brother is okay. Except their meetings
                    keep happening, and their conversations keep falling away from Sirius. Falling for James Potter
                    might just be the most reckless thing he's ever contemplated.

                    Regulus closes his eyes and shakes his head again, looking pained, then he opens them and sighs.

                    Regulus Black was fifteen the first time his name was called at a reaping. He's twenty-five when it
                    happens to him again. A lot has changed in that time, and one of them is that he's ready to do
                    whatever it takes to make it home. Nothing or no one will stop him, not even James Potter.
                    <br><br>
                    James Potter has no plans to stop Regulus Black from making it home. In fact, his plans revolve
                    around the opposite. He has his reasons, but he's made his choice to get Regulus out of the arena,
                    even knowing it'll be the last thing he ever does.
                    <br><br>
                    Sirius Black was sixteen when he volunteered to take his little brother's place in the arena. At
                    twenty-six, without the option to do it again, he has no choice but to be a mentor to his brother
                    and best friend, knowing that only one of them can make it back out.
                    <br><br>
                    Two names called, a mentor on the verge of falling apart, and more secrets and grief between all of
                    them than they know how to handle. None of them are prepared for what comes next, or how far they'll
                    go to make it through.

                    Regulus Black is the mastermind behind the Liberal party. Unfortunately, he’s never been very good
                    at the more outgoing parts of politics – on a more fortunate note, he has his brother to act as a
                    front figure. Sirius Black has always been the sweetheart of British politics, charming the voters
                    with his wit and charisma.
                    <br><br>
                    That was until James Potter came around, becoming party leader of his own party, the Leftists.
                    Sirius would probably hate him, if they weren't such good friends. Regulus does not share this
                    problem.

                    Remus Lupin literally just needed a job, and got thrown into the mess of secrets, games and an

                <p class="description">When James Potter answers a mysterious ad in his local coffee shop, the last
                    thing he expects is to be thrown into a world of white collar crime, but how can he resist when the
                    mastermind behind the operation has dark hair and brooding eyes and promises wealth beyond James'
                    wildest imagination? He would do anything for that boy named after a star, including stealing
                    millions of dollars of fine art.</p>

                    when it was his turn to make the confession. That she wouldn’t lose both sons. But he was wrong.
                    <br> <br>

                    student who plays albums that sound more like noise than melody. Peter, who’s quiet and kind and
                    brings everyone coffee and bagels from his job. And James, who seems intent on ignoring Regulus’
                    presence completely, even when Regulus gets a job beside him at their local record shop.
                    <br><br>
                    Or, James Potter was doing his best not to defile his roommate's younger brother because Sirius told
                    him to “keep his slutty hands off of Regulus or else," but finds himself unable to keep the promise.

                    Regulus knows James Potter. The kind of music he likes, what he does in his free time, every single
                    detail he can absorb.
                    <br><br>
                    James does not know him.
                    <br><br>
                    Sirius has made sure of that, keeping his mentally unwell brother far away from the object of his
                    obsession. Funnily enough, it's James who comes to Regulus. Well-meaning, curious with no idea what
                    he's getting into.
                    <br><br>
                    The lines between love and obsession are blurry and hard to read.

                        James had Regulus, but he didn’t know him. Regulus knew James but didn’t have him.

                        <br><br><br>

                        “Maybe you could,” was all Regulus could say in response. That was a truth. James could probably
                        learn Regulus inside and out. Regulus would offer that if it didn’t mean breaking down the
                        fixation—the rotting truth behind their growing relationship.

                    The Blacks want to marry off their youngest child. He begs Sirius for help and tells him a secret:
                    He is a man and would rather die than be forced to be anyone's wife.<br>
                    Panicked, Sirius arranges a marriage between his brother and his friend James Potter, knowing that
                    Regulus can be the man he is in the English countryside on James' estate.
                    <br><br>
                    James wants to ensure Regulus' happiness, even at the expense of putting his life on hold for a
                    while.
                    Regulus wants to ensure James doesn't fall into societal ruin because of him.<br>
                    Sirius wants to be loved.<br>
                    Barty must decide whether he wants to keep causing destruction or choose redemption.<br>
                    And Remus is just a very tired butler who watches James and Regulus dance around their actual
                    feelings (literally).

                    accidentally developing feelings, catastrophically failing at communication, and pretending it’s all
                    totally fine.

                    James rubbed a hand over the back of his neck, trying to find words that didn’t sound completely

                    Regulus stared at him like he’d just proposed murdering the Queen.<br>
