                    Regulus Black is angry. He wants revenge. He wants to watch the world burn for all it's done to him.
                    He also wants to make out with James Potter, but that's a secret he'll take to the grave. Vengeance
                    is more important than... whatever it is that chokes him when he lays eyes on Potter.
                    <br><br>
                    James Potter is confused, because Regulus Black is, all of a sudden, hot. And it's unfair because
                    Sirius is going to kill him if he doesn't get his impulse control in line.
                    <br><br>

                    A fic about two idiots falling in love (x2 because there's wolfstar, too) during a war, and the
                    sacrifices they'll have to make to survive it.

                    Regulus Black has realistic expectations for his life.
                    He doesn't expect privacy, he's a celebrity after all. He doesn't expect his estranged brother to
                    ever talk to him again, it's been over ten years. He certainly doesn't expect to fall in love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then somehow James Potter comes along and flips every single one of those expectations on their
                    head.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James Potter has a plan.
                    He's going to focus his career until the day he meets someone he can spend the rest of his life with
                    and settle down. This plan does not include falling in love with his best friend's long-hated
                    brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James doesn't account for Regulus Black.

                <h3 class="author">writingamarie</h3>
                <p class="description">"Baby Black, do you maybe not hate me?" James joked in a way that made Regulus
                    feel uncomfortable.<br>
                    "You are the most annoying person I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. And that says a lot
                    considering the absolute gems I've met in Slytherin."<br>
                    "A joke. Regulus Black made a joke. A mean one, at my expense, but a joke nonetheless... You know
                    baby Black, we could be friends."
                    "I would rather fling myself off the Astronomy Tower..."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ***
                    Or: Regulus is concerned about Sirius after their mother orchestrates a horrible attack. And with
                    Sirius out of reach he relies on James Potter to know his brother is okay. Except their meetings
                    keep happening, and their conversations keep falling away from Sirius. Falling for James Potter
                    might just be the most reckless thing he's ever contemplated.

                    Regulus closes his eyes and shakes his head again, looking pained, then he opens them and sighs.

                    Regulus Black was fifteen the first time his name was called at a reaping. He's twenty-five when it
                    happens to him again. A lot has changed in that time, and one of them is that he's ready to do
                    whatever it takes to make it home. Nothing or no one will stop him, not even James Potter.
                    <br><br>
                    James Potter has no plans to stop Regulus Black from making it home. In fact, his plans revolve
                    around the opposite. He has his reasons, but he's made his choice to get Regulus out of the arena,
                    even knowing it'll be the last thing he ever does.
                    <br><br>
                    Sirius Black was sixteen when he volunteered to take his little brother's place in the arena. At
                    twenty-six, without the option to do it again, he has no choice but to be a mentor to his brother
                    and best friend, knowing that only one of them can make it back out.
                    <br><br>
                    Two names called, a mentor on the verge of falling apart, and more secrets and grief between all of
                    them than they know how to handle. None of them are prepared for what comes next, or how far they'll
                    go to make it through.

                    Regulus Black is the mastermind behind the Liberal party. Unfortunately, he’s never been very good
                    at the more outgoing parts of politics – on a more fortunate note, he has his brother to act as a
                    front figure. Sirius Black has always been the sweetheart of British politics, charming the voters
                    with his wit and charisma.
                    <br><br>
                    That was until James Potter came around, becoming party leader of his own party, the Leftists.
                    Sirius would probably hate him, if they weren't such good friends. Regulus does not share this
                    problem.

                    Remus Lupin literally just needed a job, and got thrown into the mess of secrets, games and an

                <p class="description">When James Potter answers a mysterious ad in his local coffee shop, the last
                    thing he expects is to be thrown into a world of white collar crime, but how can he resist when the
                    mastermind behind the operation has dark hair and brooding eyes and promises wealth beyond James'
                    wildest imagination? He would do anything for that boy named after a star, including stealing
                    millions of dollars of fine art.</p>
