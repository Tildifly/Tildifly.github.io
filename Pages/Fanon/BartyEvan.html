                    Regulus Black has realistic expectations for his life.
                    He doesn't expect privacy, he's a celebrity after all. He doesn't expect his estranged brother to
                    ever talk to him again, it's been over ten years. He certainly doesn't expect to fall in love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then somehow James Potter comes along and flips every single one of those expectations on their
                    head.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James Potter has a plan.
                    He's going to focus his career until the day he meets someone he can spend the rest of his life with
                    and settle down. This plan does not include falling in love with his best friend's long-hated
                    brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    James doesn't account for Regulus Black.

                <h3 class="author">writingamarie</h3>
                <p class="description">"Baby Black, do you maybe not hate me?" James joked in a way that made Regulus
                    feel uncomfortable.<br>
                    "You are the most annoying person I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. And that says a lot
                    considering the absolute gems I've met in Slytherin."<br>
                    "A joke. Regulus Black made a joke. A mean one, at my expense, but a joke nonetheless... You know
                    baby Black, we could be friends."
                    "I would rather fling myself off the Astronomy Tower..."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ***
                    Or: Regulus is concerned about Sirius after their mother orchestrates a horrible attack. And with
                    Sirius out of reach he relies on James Potter to know his brother is okay. Except their meetings
                    keep happening, and their conversations keep falling away from Sirius. Falling for James Potter
                    might just be the most reckless thing he's ever contemplated.

                    Regulus Black, presumed dead for over 2 years, shows up at an Order of the Phoenix meeting with 6
                    mangled horcruxes and Voldemort's corpse.

                    to weasel his way into his heart and the friends he left behind in the name of the war aren't
                    willing to leave him alone any longer.

                    If you had told James Potter 2 weeks ago that he would be touring with Regulus Black, he would’ve
                    admitted you to a mental hospital and then driven himself off a bridge. If you had told Regulus
                    Black the same thing, he would’ve slapped you across the face.

                    appreciated, and you have saved so many lives,” she says. Barty’s heart drops for a moment.
