                <p class="description">Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being
                    forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this

                        kill you, and when I’m done with this, you’re going to want to do that to yourself. You’re going

                    “Maybe that’s my excuse then,” Sirius said. “I cause a bit of chaos now, and maybe one day, it’ll

                    After losing his mother at age eleven, Remus has spent the better part of the last four years
                    bouncing from school to school or else running around London and pretending as though he wasn't the
                    kind of well-bred boy his father brought him up to be. Now, with his chances all run out, Remus is
                    sent to Hawkings Independent School as a last-ditch effort to clean up his act. There he meets the
                    very people who will set up the rest of his life, and is forced to confront the pieces of himself
                    he'd long thought had been lost.
