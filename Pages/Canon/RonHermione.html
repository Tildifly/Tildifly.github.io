                <p class="description"> If there's one thing that Draco Malfoy yearns for, it's seeing Harry Potter in
                    pain. How that happens, he doesn't care. When Potter's name is pulled out of the Goblet of Fire,
                    Draco sees it as the perfect opportunity to fulfill his greatest desire. Except Saint Potter has
                    luck swimming in his veins. He needs to be distracted... And the best way to do that is to make him
                    fall in love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THIS IS THE REWRITTEN VERSION AND THE PREFERRED VERSION FOR YOU TO READ.
