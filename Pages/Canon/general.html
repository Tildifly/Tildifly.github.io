                <p class="description">

                    Percy Weasley is not particularly reckless, until he is, once, on the anniversary of his brother's
                    death. For most people, the idea of sending oneself through time to correct one's mistake would
                    remain a fantasy, something to dwell on in the middle of the night, but Percy has always been too
                    capable for his own good.
                    <br><br>
                    Featuring: a reluctant spy, an unlikely friendship between a ghost and a lonely student, a portrait,
                    very few friends, several very lengthy conversations about soul magic, and far too many Horcruxes.
                    <br><br>
                    (Or, an attempt to answer the question, if someone intelligent was sent back through time, armed
                    only with the word 'Horcrux' and a general knowledge of the main timeline––not to mention a keen
                    understanding of the Hogwarts curriculum––could that person logic his way to defeating the Dark
                    Lord? Only time will tell).
                    <br><br>
                    COMPLETE.

                <p class="description">Severus had always known that he would die in a painful, most horrifying way ever
                    since back when he was almost beaten to death by his father, then mauled by a werewolf, then
                    thrashed around by a maniac overlord. His miserable, luckless life only seemed to lead to that one
                    day when he would be struck down by a bloody snake, of all things.
                    <br>Bleeding out in front of Harry Potter was just the last humiliation Lady Destiny had in store
                    for him.
                    Suddenly staring into Potter senior’s eyes again while being levicorpused was just the icing on the
                    cake.

                <p class="description">Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor.<br>“What
                    year is it, Riddle.”
                    <br>It wasn’t phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.<br>
                    “September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”’
                    <br>Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing
                    as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.
                    <br>“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that’s a problem.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with
                    no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not
                    murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even
                    fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to-
                    <br><em>'Please God, let me live.</em>

                <p class="description">Harry’s survived impossible odds all his life: his hateful relatives, their
                    abrupt decision to kick him out, and then years spent staying alive on the streets of London.

                    <br><br>He’s excellent at surviving impossible situations. His magic powers don’t hurt his odds at
                    all either.
                    <br><br>
                    And now? Getting to go to a school filled with other magical students? Getting a gang of his own?
                    Fighting headmasters who don’t seem to like him and learning occlumency from his professor?
                    <br><br>
                    Life is brill now.
                    <br><br><br>


                    Life is not so ‘brill’ for Severus Snape who sees a small boy covered in scars and filled with
                    trauma and worries about how to best fulfill his vow to keep the boy safe when the boy has a knack
                    for brewing constant chaos.
